***MidiJoy version 1***
This folder contains the files for MidiJoy 1.  
This version differs from MidiJoy 2 in the main folder in that it 
- does not support pitch bend
- does not support PokeyMax's extra functions (i.e. multiple POKEYs or other soundchips)
- **does** allow the usage of recorded sounds in own programs (MidiJoy 2 can theoretically also do that, but I have not yet adjusted the player routines because of the several soundchips that would need to be addressed)

The only reason you want to use MidiJoy 1 is if you want to use your own recordings in your own Atari software. You can still record and playback your recordings with MidiJoy 2, but not use them in your own software yet.

**Attention**: There are several MidiJoy.asm files here. Please only use MidiJoy3.asm and MidiJoy3.xex. After all these years, I forgot why I kept MidiJoy.asm and MidiJoy2.asm, but whatever it was, I didn't continue working on them. So MidiJoy3.asm is **not** newer than MidiJoy 2 in the main folder!
